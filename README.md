# Live Photo Commentary

A script workflow for automated live spoken commenting on photos shown on screen.

At the moment it is configured to run image understaning via the Gemini API (available for free for now...) or use the Phi 3.5 vision-instruct model locally. Speech is generated using the Kokoro-82M model.
